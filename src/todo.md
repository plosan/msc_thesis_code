For a polynomial $f = x^a + y^b + g$, where $(a, b) = 1$ and $g$ is a constant Milnor number deformation of $x^a + y^b$, compute:
* Chain of ideals 

x^a + y^b = def, (a, b) = 1, constant Milnor number

x^7 + y^5 + def, p = 5, 7, 11, chain, codimension, F_star^e basis expression, e = 1, 2, 3, ...
-x^7 + y^6 + def, p = 5, 7, 11, chain, codim, F_star^e basis expression, e = 1, 2, 3, ...
